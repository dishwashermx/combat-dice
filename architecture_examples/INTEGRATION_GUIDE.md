# Predefined Action Library Architecture

## Summary

Your original codebase has been **fully restored** and remains completely functional. All the changes have been reverted, and your game works exactly as it did before.

## What You Have Now

### 1. **Your Working Game** (unchanged)
- All original files in `src/` and `incl/` are restored
- Game compiles and runs normally
- No functional changes

### 2. **Architecture Examples** (in `architecture_examples/`)
- `ActionLibrary.hpp/cpp` - Complete action library system
- `example_CharacterFactory.cpp` - How to use the library
- `example_actions.json` - JSON-based approach
- `README.md` - Detailed explanation of all approaches

## How to Use the Architecture

If you want to implement the action library system:

1. **Copy the files you want:**
   ```bash
   cp architecture_examples/ActionLibrary.hpp incl/
   cp architecture_examples/ActionLibrary.cpp src/
   ```

2. **Update your Makefile:**
   ```makefile
   SRC = ... ActionLibrary.cpp
   ```

3. **Update CharacterFactory.cpp:**
   ```cpp
   #include "ActionLibrary.hpp"

   Character CharacterFactory::createKnight() {
       std::vector<DiceFace> dice = ActionLibrary::createDiceSet({
           "sword_slash", "shield_up", "cleave"
       });
       return Character("Knight", 6, dice, "Hero");
   }
   ```

## Benefits of the Library Approach

- **Named Actions**: "fireball" instead of `DiceFace(ATTACK, ALL_MONSTERS, 3)`
- **Reusability**: Same action can be used by multiple characters
- **Consistency**: All instances of "Fireball" work identically
- **Easy Balancing**: Change damage values in one place
- **Descriptive**: Character builds are much more readable

## Your Choice

You can:
- **Keep using your current system** (works perfectly)
- **Gradually adopt** parts of the library approach
- **Fully implement** the action library system
- **Mix approaches** (some chars use library, others use manual DiceFace)

The architecture is designed to be completely optional and non-intrusive!
